Maintain your task list using an array of objects, where each object represents an individual task containing properties such as a description and a completion status (true or false). Every time a task is added, edited, removed, or its completion status is toggled, ensure that the tasks array is updated accordingly.
Create a function called renderTasks that first clears all the existing tasks from the DOM and then re-renders the task list based on the current state of the tasks array.
This mini-project will give you hands-on experience with array operations, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating the web page using JavaScript.
